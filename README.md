With Read4Me Clipboard Reader you can let your computer read you the contents of the clipboard using a pre-installed SAPI5 TTS voice when a hotkey is pressed. You can set multiple hotkeys for multiple languages, voices, speech rates and volumes. Furthermore the program can convert text files to mp3.

New: Now with language detection option! Language detection detects the language of the copied text and reads it with one of your predefined voices.

I am looking for collaborators for this project, so if you have interest to help, mail me.
